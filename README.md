# Shopping cart

Created by Josiah Eakle 
    using React 
    styled with no Frameworks

Odin Project assignment -
        Create a UI for a store
        No checkout logic
        Use react router


While it took me a minute to properly handle the cart being sent to each component, 
    I eventally figured it out. I am happy with how it ended up looking as well.
